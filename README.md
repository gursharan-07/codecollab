🚀 CodeCollab
Find your perfect tech study partner. Learn better, together.
CodeCollab is a web platform that connects learners, developers, and students based on tech stack, goals, and learning pace — with simple gamification, partner matching, and a personalized dashboard.
Built in 20 hours during a hackathon using Lovable AI (Frontend) + Supabase (Backend).
🌟 Problem
Learning tech alone is difficult.

No accountability or study partner
